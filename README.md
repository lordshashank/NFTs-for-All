<h3 align="center">Cricket Classic NFTs</h3>

  <p align="center">
  This is an NFT marketplace made solely for cricket purposes in ICC NIUM Hackathon 2023. This marketplace consists of NFTs for cricket fans. These NFTs can represent specific moments in the game, historical moments, or unique merchandise items that fans can own as digital assets. These NFTs could be turned fractional allowing more people to participate due to reasonable prices and wide availability. We also can create NFT Passes that could be owned die-hard cricket fans (like me), giving them free passes to matches and a lot of other benefits. These passes will be on a Subscription basis i.e. fans would not always be owners of them, they would have to renew them regularly or NFTs would be back to the market.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

We have designed a complete marketplace for different types of NFTs, be they fractional, general, or subscription-based NFTs, our marketplace will be a one-stop solution. You must have heard of different NFT marketplaces for different types of NFTs, so why not have one complete solution for all types of NFTs? This is what our marketplace solves.
Moreover, the feature of subscription-based NFT contracts is still in development and none of the EIPs have been able to implement it perfectly. We ourselves have made a minimal Subscription NFT contract which looks after to improve and make perfect.
Thus, our marketplace gives users the complete choice to own and trade any type of NFTs independently.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Our product would be beneficial for all the NFT enthusiasts who were quite frustrated with the lack of a complete marketplace for all types of NFTs. We have made a complete marketplace for all types of NFTs, be it general, fractional, or subscription-based NFTs. People can shift to our marketplace so as to handle all these types of NFTs at one place.
