<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

NFA is one stop NFT solution for users, where users get various options like fractional NFTs, subscription based NFTs, and of course the regular NFTs. Currently, user has to use different marketplaces to interact with these different types of NFTs which is quite hectic and tough to handle. Through our marketplace, users can handle all of them easily at one site.

NFTs are an important aspect of the Ethereum foundation. Our project NFA aims to increase the utilities of NFTs by opening various ways to interact with them at one place. Currently, there are many marketplaces like opensea which work on general NFTs, fractional.art which work specifically on fractional NFTs, etc. Our marketplace aims to provide these and many more features at one place with very easy transition between them.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Our marketplace tends to solve the problems that users face while interacting with NFTs with current available marketplaces. some examples are:
Let's say a person creates an NFT and puts it on sale but it doesn't do well in market, he can fractionalize it with just one click and handle the fractions easily at NFA. Fractionalizing will increase market as well as reduce price for his NFTs increasing chances of his NFTs being sold.
Similarly, user getting buyers for all his NFTs may want to put it on subscription so as to earn more from it. He can do that easily with just one click at NFA.
These are just some use cases, there are many other ways one can use our marketplace for their profit.
